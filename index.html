    <h5 class="text">Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry - The little prince</h5>
    <p class="text2">TO LEON WERTH</p>
    <p class="text3">
      I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating
      it to a grown-up. I have a serious reason: he is the best friend I have in
      the world. I have another reason: this grown-up understands everything,
      even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where
      he is hungry and cold. He needs cheering <br />
      up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the
      child from whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups were once children -
      although few of them remember it. And so I correct my dedication:
    </p>
    <p class="text4">TO LEON WERTH WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY</p>
    <hr />
    <p class="text0"></p>
    <h5 class="text5">I</h5>
    <p class="text6">
      Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book,
      called <i>True Stories from Nature</i>, about the primeval forest. It was
      a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is
      a copy of the drawing.
    </p>
    <div>
      <img
        class="img"
        src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/hroznys.jpg"
      />
    </div>
    <p class="text7">
      In the book it said:
      <i
        >'Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After
        that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months
        that they need for digestion."</i
      >
    </p>
    <p class="text8">
      I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some
      work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My
      Drawing Number One. It looked something like this:
    </p>
    <div class="img2">
      <img
        src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/klobouk.jpg"
        alt="img2"
      />
    </div>
    <p class="text9">
      I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the
      drawing frightened them.
    </p>
    <p class="text10">
      But they answered:
      <i>"Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"</i>
    </p>
    <p class="text11">
      My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa
      constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able
      to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa
      constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need
      to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this:
    </p>
    <div class="img3">
      <img
        src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/slon.jpg"
        alt="img3"
      />
    </div>
    <p class="text12">
      The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my
      drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and
      devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That
      is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent
      career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing
      Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything
      by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever
      explaining things to them.
    </p>
    <p class="text13">
      So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have
      flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography
      has been very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China from
      Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.
    </p>
    <p class="text14">
      In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great
      many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence. I have
      lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately, close at
      hand. And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them.
    </p>
    <p class="text15">
      Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried
      the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always
      kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true
      understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say:
    </p>
    <h5 class="text16"><i>"That is a hat."</i></h5>

    <p class="text17">
      Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval
      forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to
      him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the grown-up
      would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h5 class="text18">II</h5>

    <p class="text19">
      So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to,
      until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years
      ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a
      mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs
      all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely
      enough drinking water to last a week.

    </p>
    <h5 class="text21"><i>"If you please--draw me a sheep!"</i></h5>

    <h5 class="text22"><i>"What!"</i></h5>

    <h5 class="text23"><i>"Draw me a sheep!"</i></h5>

    <p class="text24">
      I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked my eyes hard. I
      looked carefully all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small
      person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness. Here you may
      see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But my
      drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model.
    </p>

    <div class="img4">
      <img
        src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/malyPrinc.jpg"
        alt="img4"
      />
    </div>
    <p class="text25">
      That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my
      painter's career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw
      anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.
    </p>
    <p class="text26">
      Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of
      my head in astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand
      miles from any inhabited region. And yet my little man seemed neither to
      be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue
      or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a
      child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human
      habitation. When at last I was able to speak, I said to him:
    </p>
    <h5 class="text27"><i>"But--what are you doing here?"</i></h5>

    <p class="text28">
      And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter
      of great consequence:
    </p>

    <h5 class="text29"><i>"If you please--draw me a sheep..."</i></h5>

    <p class="text30">
      When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it
      might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger
      of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen.
      But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography,
      history, arithmetic and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little
      crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw. He answered me:
    </p>

    <h5 class="text31"><i>"That doesn't matter. Draw me a sheep..."</i></h5>
    <p class="text32">
      But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I
      had drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside.
      And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with:
    </p>
    <h5 class="text33">
      <i
        >"No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa
        constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very
        cumbersome. Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a
        sheep. Draw me a sheep."</i
      >
    </h5>
    <p class="text34">So then I made a drawing.</p>
    <div class="img5">
      <img
        src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/nemocnyBeranek.jpg"
        alt="img5"
      />
    </div>
    <p class="text35">He looked at it carefully, then he said:</p>
    <h5 class="text36">
      <i>"No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another."</i>
    </h5>
    <p class="text37">So I made another drawing.</p>

    <div class="img6">
      <img
        src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/Beran.jpg"
        alt="img6"
      />
    </div>
    <p class="text38">My friend smiled gently and indulgently.</p>

    <h5 class="text39">
      <i
        >"You see yourself," he said, "that this is not a sheep. This is a ram.
        It has horns."</i
      >
    </h5>
    <p class="text40">So then I did my drawing over once more.</p>

    <p class="text41">But it was rejected too, just like the others.</p>

    <h5 class="text42">
      <i>"This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time."</i>
    </h5>

    <div class="img7">
      <img
        src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/staryBeranek.jpg"
        alt="img7"
      />
    </div>
    <p class="text43">
      By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start
      taking my engine apart. So I tossed off this drawing.
    </p>
    <div class="img8">
      <img
        src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/krabice.jpg"
        alt="img8"
      />
    </div>
    <p class="text45">And I threw out an explanation with it.</p>
    <h5 class="text46">
      <i>"This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside."</i>
    </h5>
    <p class="text47">
      I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:
    </p>
    <h5 class="text48">
      "This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside."
    </h5>
    <h5 class="text60">
      <i
        >"That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will
        have to have a great deal of grass?"
      </i>
    </h5>
    <h5 class="text49"><i>"Why?"</i></h5>

    <h5 class="text50">
      <i>"Because where I live everything is very small..."</i>
    </h5>
    <h5 class="text51">
      <i
        >"There will surely be enough grass for him," I said. "It is a very
        small sheep that I have given you."</i
      >
    </h5>
    <p class="text52">He bent his head over the drawing.</p>
    <h5 class="text53">
      <i>"Not so small that--Look! He has gone to sleep..."</i>
    </h5>
    <p class="text54">
      And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince.
